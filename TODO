Work on chapter titles, it has started good, but few last chapters have long names and are not consistent with first chapters'title
Add introduction and other required and non required chapters
Fonts and border - graphics maybe
Research publishing - online publishing
Review by others
References should reference to each verse on tanzil, quran and noor
A collection of these verses should be created 

بعضی ایات ادامه هاشون رو نیاوردم بررسی کن جا داره آیات رو کامل بیاریم یا نه که معنی کاملا منتقل بشه
chapters' name
chapters' appearance
There is an extra blank page at the end of each chapter, remove it

Currently it doesn't look like a book, it looks like a collection of verses. It should look like a book.
The book should be reviewed by a few people, and then published online.

Read some books that has written with latex and see how they have done it.(Open books I mean or someone who is open to share his/her experience with latex with you)
